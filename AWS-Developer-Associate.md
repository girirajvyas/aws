### How to choose AWS Region for deploying new application?
 - **Compliance:** Their might be data governance and legal requirements about the data, for instance we have GDPR. In such scenarios where data cannot leave a specific region you have to select the region where the data is being collected
 - **Proximity to customers:** It is an obvious choice that you will deploy your application where your customers are to have reduced latency 
 - **Service Availability within region:** In case you are planning to use a new service or a new feature, then it is not always a scenario that it is launched for all regions. In such cases you might have to stick with the region where it is launched
 - **Pricing:** pricing changes per region. you might want to have a look at this as well to optimize your billing
