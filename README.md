### 2.2 Where to start

This is the question that comes to mind when we plan to take any certification. Ideally if you see the image above, AWS has certain guidelines of how many years of experience one must have to appear that certification. These are just guidelines and your timeline can be different from the one recommended by AWS

Ideal flow is:
 Certifid Cloud Practitioner -> Certified solutions Architect - Associate -> Certified Developer - Associate

The flow depicted above is the normal one and not strictly followed you can do them in any order and can do any one directly. This is generally what people do  

Also, their will be some steps and resources that are common across and will mention them in below sections
