1. You have an RDS DB instance that's configured to push its database logs to CloudWatch. You want to create a CloudWatch alarm if there's an Error found in the logs. How would you do that?
a. Create a scheduled CloudWatch event that triggers an AWS Lambda every 1 hour, scans the logs, and notify through SNS topic
b. Create a CloudWatch Logs Metric Filter that filter the logs for keyword Error, then create a cloudwatch Alarm based on that metric filter
c. Create an AWS config rule that monitors Error in your database logs and notify you through SNS topic
Ans: 
b 

2. You have an application hosted on a fleet of EC2 instances managed by an Auto Scaling Group that you configured its minimum capacity to 2. Also, you have created a CloudWatch Alarm that is configured to scale in your ASG when CPU Utilization is below 60%.

a. one EC2 instance will be terminated and the ASG desired and minimum capacity will go to 1
b. The CloudWatch Alarm will remain in ALARM state but never decrease the number of EC2 instances in the ASG
c. The CloudWatch Alarm will be detached from my ASG
d. The CloudWatch Alarm will go in OK state
Ans: 
b. The number of EC2 instances in an ASG can not go below the minimum capacity, even if the CloudWatch alarm would in theory trigger an EC2 instance termination.

3. How would you monitor your EC2 instance memory usage in CloudWatch?
a. Enable EC2 detailed monitoring

c

4. You have made a configuration change and would like to evaluate the impact of it on the performance of your application. Which AWS service should you use?
a. CloudWatch
b. CloudTrail
Ans:
a, correct: Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring service that allows you to monitor your applications, respond to system-wide performance changes, optimize resource utilization, and get a unified view of operational health. It is used to monitor your applications' performance and metrics.
b incorect: AWS CloudTrail allows you to log, continuously monitor, and retain account activity related to actions across your AWS infrastructure. It provides the event history of your AWS account activity, audit API calls made through the AWS Management Console, AWS SDKs, AWS CLI. You can use CloudTrail to detect unusual activity in your AWS accounts.

a. CloudWatch Metrics
b. CloudWatch Alarms
c. CloudWatch Events
d. CloudTrail
Ans:
d, correct: AWS CloudTrail allows you to log, continuously monitor, and retain account activity related to actions across your AWS infrastructure. It provides the event history of your AWS account activity, audit API calls made through the AWS Management Console, AWS SDKs, AWS CLI. So, the EC2 instance termination API call will appear here. You can use CloudTrail to detect unusual activity in your AWS accounts.

6. You have CloudTrail enabled for your AWS Account in all AWS Regions. What should you use to detect unusual activity in your AWS Account?
a. CloudTrail Data Events
b. CloudTrail Insights
c. CloudTrail Management Events
Ans:
b 

7. One of your teammates terminated an EC2 instance 4 months ago which has critical data. You don't know who made this so you are going to review all API calls within this period using CloudTrail. You already have CloudTrail set up and configured to send logs to the S3 bucket. What should you do to find out who made this?
a. Use CloudTrail event history in cloudtrail Console
b. Analyze CloudTrail logs in S3 bucket using Amazon Athena
Ans:
b, You can use the CloudTrail Console to view the last 90 days of recorded API activity. For events older than 90 days, use Athena to analyze CloudTrail logs stored in S3.

8. You are running a website on a fleet of EC2 instances with OS that has a known vulnerability on port 84. You want to continuously monitor your EC2 instances if they have port 84 exposed. How should you do this?
a. Setup cloudwatch metrics
b. Setup cloudtrail Trails
c. Setup config rules
d. Schedule a CloudWatch event to trigger a Lambda function to scan your EC2 instances
Ans:
c 

9. You would like to evaluate the compliance of your resource's configurations over time. Which AWS service will you choose?
a. AWS Config
b. CloudWatch
c. CloudTrail 
Ans:
a 

10. Someone changed the configuration of a resource and made it non-compliant. Which AWS service can you use to find out who made the change?
a. CloudWatch
b. CloudTrail
c. Config
Ans:
b 

11. You have enabled AWS Config to monitor Security Groups if there's unrestricted SSH access to any of your EC2 instances. Which AWS Config feature can you use to automatically re-configure your Security Groups to their correct state?
a. AWS COnfig Remediations
b. AWS config Rules
c. AWS COnfig Notifications
Ans:
a 

12. You are running a critical website on a set of EC2 instances with a tightened Security Group that has restricted SSH access. You have enabled AWS Config in your AWS Region and you want to be notified via email when someone modified your EC2 instances' Security Group. Which AWS Config feature helps you do this?
a. AWS Config Remediations
b. AWS Config Rules
c. AWS Config Notifications
Ans:
c 

13. .... is a CloudWatch feature that allows you to send CloudWatch metrics in near real-time to S3 bucket (through Kinesis Data Firehose) and 3rd party destinations (e.g., Splunk, Datadog, â€¦).
a. CloudWatch Metric Stream
b. CloudWatch Log Stream
c. CloudWatch Metric Filter
d. CloudWatch Log Group
Ans:

14. A DevOps engineer is working for a company and managing its infrastructure and resources on AWS. There was a sudden spike in traffic for the main application for the company which was not normal in this period of the year. The application is hosted on a couple of EC2 instances in private subnets and is fronted by an Application Load Balancer in a public subnet. To detect if this is normal traffic or an attack, the DevOps engineer enabled the VPC Flow Logs for the subnets and stored those logs in CloudWatch Log Group. The DevOps wants to analyze those logs and find out the top IP addresses making requests against the website to check if there is an attack. Which of the following can help the DevOps engineer to analyze those logs?
a. CloudWatch Metric Stream
b. CloudWatch Alarm
c. CloudWatch Contributor Insights
d. CloudWatch Metric Filter
Ans:
c 

15. A company is developing a Serverless application on AWS using Lambda, DynamoDB, and Cognito. A junior developer joined a few weeks ago and accidentally deleted one of the DynamoDB tables in the dev AWS account which contained important data. The CTO asks you to prevent this from happening again and there must be a notification system to monitor if there is an attempt to make such deletion actions for the DynamoDB tables. What would you do?
a. Assign developers to certain IAM group which prevents deletion of DynamoDB tables. Configure EventBridge to capture any "DeleteTable" API calls through S3 and send a notification using KMS
b. Assign developers to certain IAM group which prevents deletion of DynamoDB tables.
Configure EventBridge to capture any "DeleteTable" API calls through CloudTrail and send a notification using SNS
c. Assign developers to certain IAM group which prevents deletion of DynamoDB tables.
Configure EventBridge to capture any "DeleteTable" API calls and send a notification using KMS
Ans:

16. A company has a running Serverless application on AWS which uses EventBridge as an inter-communication channel between different services within the application. There is a requirement to use the events in the prod environment in the dev environment to make some tests. The tests will be done every 6 months, so the events need to be stored and used later on. What is the most efficient and cost-effective way to store EventBridge events and use them later?
a. Use EventBridge Archive and replay feature
b. Create a Lambda function to store the EventBridge events in a s3 bucket for later usage
c. Configure EventBridge to store events in a DynamoDB table
